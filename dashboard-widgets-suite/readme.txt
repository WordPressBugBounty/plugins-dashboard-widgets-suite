**User Notes Widget**

As of DWS version 1.9, you can choose a format for each user note:

* Text (default)
* HTML
* Code

How to choose a note format:

1. Click the "Add Note" link
2. In the "Format" select menu, choose your format
3. Write your note how you want, click the "Add Note" button and done!

To __Edit__ or __Delete__ any note, double-click on the note content (to display the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons).


**Debug and Error Logs**

Note that the Debug and Error Log widgets may require a bit of configuration, depending on your WP setup. Here is a quick guide:

__Debug Log__

To enable the WP Debug Log for the Debug Log widget, make sure that debug mode is enabled in your site's `wp-config.php` file. Here is one possible way to enable, by adding the following code to your wp-config file, just before the line that says, "That's all, stop editing!":

	define('WP_DEBUG', true);
	define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
	define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);

Once added, this will tell WP to log all errors, warnings, and notices to a file named `debug.log`, which is located in the `/wp-content/` directory. Note that if the file does not exist, you can create it manually and give it suitable permissions. Ask your web host if unsure.

__Error Log__

To enable the Error Log for the Error Log widget, follow the same steps as for "Debug Log", but use this code instead:

	define('WP_DEBUG', true); 
	ini_set('display_errors', 'Off');
	ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);

And also make sure to set the correct file path under the plugin's "Error Log" tab, in the setting "Log Location".

__Debug Log and Error Log__

To enable both Debug Log and Error Log, follow the same steps as above, but use this code instead:

	define('WP_DEBUG', true);
	define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
	define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
	ini_set('display_errors', 'Off');
	ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);

**Uninstalling**

Dashboard Widgets Suite cleans up after itself. All plugin settings will be removed from your database when the plugin is uninstalled via the Plugins screen.



**Restore Default Options**

To restore default plugin options, either uninstall/reinstall the plugin or visit the General Settings &gt; Restore default plugin options.



**Shortcodes**

DWS provides several shortcodes for displaying widgets on the frontend of your site. Here is a summary:

	[dws_feed_box]   => Feed Box
	[dws_social_box] => Social Box
	[dws_user_notes] => User Notes
	
You can add these to any WP Post or Page to display the widget on the frontend. The same widget settings apply to both frontend and backend display.



**Customizing**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


**Can you add this widget or that widget?**

Yeah maybe, feel free to [suggest a widget!](https://plugin-planet.com/support/#contact)


**How to customize the names of dashboard widgets?**

It's not a current feature of the plugin, however it is possible using custom functions. Check out this [tutorial](https://perishablepress.com/custom-widget-names-dashboard-widgets-suite/) at Perishable Press.


**How to add a widget that displays all pages?**

To display a Dashboard widget that displays links to all of your pages:

1. Visit the Widget Box tab on the plugin page
2. Check the box for the setting, Enable Widget
3. Select Dashboard Widgets Suite for the Sidebar setting
4. Save changes
5. Visit the Menus screen under the Appearance menu
6. Create a menu that displays all Pages (or whatever links you want)
7. Visit the WP Widgets screen
8. Add your new widget to Dashboard Widgets Suite

Done! You can now visit the Dashboard to view your new menu in the Widget Box.


**How to edit or delete a note?**

Double click on the note itself, and buttons will be displayed, enabling Edit, Delete, etc.


**Who can view the notes?**

For each note, you can specify a level/role user that is allowed to view/read. So any user who has the capabilities of the specified role can read the note. For example, if you set a note level to "Author", then users with role of Author, Editor, or Admin will be able to read.


**How to set a required note format?**

By default, the user may choose which format (text, html, code) they want for each note. To change that, so that only one format is used, add the following code to your theme (or child theme) functions.php, or add via simple [custom plugin](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/):

	function dashboard_widgets_suite_notes_format_custom($field_default) {
		
		return 'text'; // accepts: text, html, code
		
	}
	add_filter('dashboard_widgets_suite_notes_format', 'dashboard_widgets_suite_notes_format_custom');

Change `text` to any accepted format: text, html, or code.


**How to add my own note styles?**

To override the default note styles, add the following code to your theme (or child theme) functions.php, or add via simple [custom plugin](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/):

	function dashboard_widgets_suite_note_styles_custom($css) {
		
		return '#dws-notes-user .dws-notes-user textarea, #dws-notes-user .dws-notes-user-note { font-size: 18px; }';
		
	}
	add_filter('dashboard_widgets_suite_note_styles', 'dashboard_widgets_suite_note_styles_custom');

The returned CSS code is just an example, showing use of DWS existing selectors. You can change the CSS to whatever is necessary.


**How to change path/location of the debug log?**

By default, the WordPress debug file is located at `/wp-content/debug.log`. To change that, add the following code to your theme (or child theme) functions.php, or add via simple [custom plugin](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/):

	function dashboard_widgets_suite_log_debug_path($log) {
	
		return '/whatever/path/debug.log'; 
	
	}
	add_filter('dashboard_widgets_suite_log_debug_path', 'dashboard_widgets_suite_log_debug_path');

Change the path to whatever is necessary.
